# Manage work items

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Work items help you plan and manage your project by tracking different types of work, such as user stories, product backlog items, tasks, bugs, or issues. Use work items to describe the work to be done, assign tasks, track status, and coordinate efforts within your team.

Once you [create work items](../work-items/view-add-work-items.md), managing work items involves the following key tasks:

- [Update work items](#update-work-items)
- [Link work items](#link-to-a-work-item)
- [Follow work items](#follow-a-work-item)
- [Add attachments](#add-attachments)
- [Delete attachments](#delete-attachments)
- [Permanently delete attachments](#permanently-delete-attachments)

By effectively managing work items, you can ensure that your project stays on track and that all team members are aligned on the work to be done.

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/prerequisites-work-items.md)]

## Update work items

As work progresses, team members can update the state and reassign it as needed. While the workflow states differ for different work item types, they usually follow a progression from New or Active to Completed or Done. 

#### [Browser](#tab/browser/) 

The following image shows the workflow states for a user story. If you want to discard a work item, change the state to Removed, or you can delete it. For more information, see [Move, change, or remove a work item](remove-delete-work-items.md).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot showing updating the state of a user story.](media/add-work/update-state.png)  

:::row:::
   :::column span="2":::
      **Typical workflow progression:**
      - The product owner creates a user story in the **New** state with the default reason, **New user story**   
      - The team updates the status to **Active** when they decide to complete the work during the sprint  
      - A user story is moved to **Resolved** when the team completes all its associated tasks and unit tests for the story pass.  
      - A user story is moved to the **Closed** state when the product owner agrees that the story is implemented according to the Acceptance Criteria and acceptance tests pass.  
    
**Atypical transitions**: 
      - Change the State from **Active** to **New**.  
      - Change the State from **Resolved** to **Active**.  
      - Change the State from **Resolved** to **New**.  
      - Change the State from **Closed** to **Active**.  
      - Change the State from **New** to **Removed**.  
      - Change the State from **Removed** to **New**.  
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      ![Screenshot of user story workflow, Agile process.](../work-items/guidance/media/alm_pt_agile_wf_userstory.png)  
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

Removed work items remain in the data store and can be reactivated by changing the State.   

With each update, changes are recorded in the History field, which you can view through the **History** tab.  

![Screenshot of viewing change history.](media/add-work-item-history.png)  

To find work items based on their history, see [History & auditing](../queries/history-and-auditing.md).

### [Visual Studio 2019](#tab/visual-studio/)

You can't update a work item using Visual Studio 2019 at this time.

### Link to a work item

Add links to work items to show relationships between them and other work items or objects. For example, link a bug to a user story to indicate that the bug is blocking the user story. You can also link work items to commits, pull requests, builds, and other objects.

Set the link relationship to various types, including **Parent**, **Child**, and **Duplicate**.

For more information, see [Link work items to objects](../backlogs/add-link.md).

## Follow a work item

To track the progress of a single work item, select the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/follow-icon.png" border="false"::: follow icon. This action notifies you when changes are made to the work item.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot showing Work item form, Follow icon control.](../work-items/media/follow-work/follow-work-item.png) 

You receive notifications only when other project members modify the work item, such as when they add to the discussion, change a field value, or add an attachment.

Notifications are sent to your preferred email address, which you can [change from your user profile](../../organizations/notifications/change-email-address.md).

To stop following changes, select the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/following-icon.png" border="false"::: following icon.

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To support the **follow** feature, configure an [SMTP server](/azure/devops/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts) for team members to receive notifications.

::: moniker-end

<a id="sort"></a>

## Add columns and sort by a column 

Sort your view by any column field selected from the **Column Options** dialog in the web portal. For more information, see [Change column options](../backlogs/set-column-options.md).

## Copy selected items to the clipboard or email them

To select several items in a sequence, hold down the **Shift** key on a web portal page. To select non-sequential items, use the **Ctrl** key. Then, use **Ctrl+C** to copy the selected items to the clipboard. Alternatively, open the context menu for the selected work items, select the ![actions icon](../media/icons/actions-icon.png), and select an option from the menu.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of web portal, Work Items page, Following view, Select multiple work items, open context menu.](../work-items/media/view-add/following-context-menu.png)

## Add attachments

1. From your work item, select the **Attachments** tab > **Add attachment**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/add-attachment.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing highlighted Attachments button in work item.":::

2. Select the file, select **Open**, and then **Save**. 

The attachment is added to the work item.

## Delete attachments

1. From your work item, select the **Attachments** tab. 
2. Select **more actions** :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/more-actions.png" border="false"::: > **Delete attachment**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/delete-attachment.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing delete attachment flow.":::

3. Select **Delete** to confirm you want to delete the attachment.

   :::image type="content" source="media/confirm-delete-attachment.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Delete button for confirming delete action.":::

The deleted attachment cannot be restored and is permanently removed after 28 days. In the meantime, if you have permissions, you can [permanently delete](#permanently-delete-attachments) it.

## Permanently delete attachments

To permanently delete attachments, you need **Permanently delete work items** permissions. This action is typically reserved for situations requiring immediate removal, such as when files are infected. Otherwise, deleted attachments will be automatically removed within 28 days.

1. From your work item, select the **Attachments** tab. 
2. Select **more actions** :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/more-actions.png" border="false"::: > **Permanently delete attachment**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/permanently-delete-attachment.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing permanently delete attachment flow.":::

3. Select **Delete** to confirm you want to permanently delete the attachment.

   :::image type="content" source="media/confirm-permanently-delete-attachment.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Delete button for confirming permanent delete action.":::

The attachment is permanently deleted and isn't accessible from any other links.
