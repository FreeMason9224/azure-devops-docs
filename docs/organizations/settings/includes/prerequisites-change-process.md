## Prerequisites

- **Permissions:**
  - To create, delete, or edit a process, be a member of the [**Project Collection Administrators** group](../../security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md), or have specific collection-level permissions **Create process**, **Delete process**, **Edit process**, or **Delete a field from organization**. For more information, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking, Customize an inherited process](../../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#customize-an-inherited-process).
  - To update boards, be the [Team Administrator](../add-team-administrator.md) or a member of the [**Project Administrators** group](../../security/change-project-level-permissions.md).
- **Access:** 
  - Even if you have **Basic** or **Stakeholder** access, you can still change a process if someone gives you permissions to do so.  
  - To update and change the type of your existing work items, be a member of the project.
